    "# Assignment 2 - Classification benchmarks with Logistic Regression and Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we'll be writing scripts which classify the ```Cifar10``` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load** the **Cifar10 dataset**\n",
    "- **Preprocess** the data (e.g. **greyscale**, **reshape**)\n",
    "- **Train** a **classifier** on the **data**\n",
    "- **Save** a **classification report**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write **two script**: which does this for a **logistic regression classifier** and one which does it for a **neural network classifier**. In both cases, you should use the machine learning tools available via ```scikit-learn```.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "- You should structure your project by \n",
    "    - folder called ```src``` where **scripts** are saved\n",
    "    - folder called ```out``` where the **classification reports** are saved.\n",
    "- Consider using some of the things we've seen in class, such as **virtual environments** *venv* and **setup scripts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "- able to use ```scikit-learn```  for building **simple benchmark classifiers** on **image classification data**\n",
    "- able to build **reproducible pipelines** for **machine learning projects**\n",
    "- able to **structure repos** appropriately\n",

# Assignment 2 - Classification benchmarks with Logistic Regression and Neural Networks
The portfolio exam for Visual Analytics S22 consists of 4 projects; three class assignments and one self-assigned project. This is the repository for the second assignment in the portfolio.
## 1. Contributions
The code was produced by me, but with a lot of problem-solving looking into various Stack Overflow blog posts.

## 2. Initial assignment description by instructor
For this assignment, we'll be writing scripts which classify the ```Cifar10``` dataset.

You should write code which does the following:

- Load the Cifar10 dataset
- Preprocess the data (e.g. greyscale, reshape)
- Train a classifier on the data
- Save a classification report

You should write one script which does this for a logistic regression classifier **and** one which does it for a neural network classifier. In both cases, you should use the machine learning tools available via ```scikit-learn```.

## 2.1 Tips

- You should structure your project by having scripts saved in a folder called ```src```, and have a folder called ```out``` where you save the classification reports.
- Consider using some of the things we've seen in class, such as virtual environments and setup scripts.

## 2.2 Purpose

- To ensure that you can use ```scikit-learn``` to build simple benchmark classifiers on image classification data
- To demonstrate that you can build reproducible pipelines for machine learning projects
- To make sure that you can structure repos appropriately

## 3. Methods
**Logistic Regression model** The logireg_cifar10.py script uses different functions to load and preprocess the CIFAR_10 data set. The preprocessed data is then used as input for training a logistic regression model and predicting classes of the validation data based on the model which is saved in a classification report.
**Neural Network model** The neural_cifar10.py script uses the same loading and processing functions as mentioned in the section above. The output  are then used to train a network classification model. The model is compiled and trained on the input data, and an evaluation of the model is saved in a classification report.

# 4. Usage
This script was made using python 3.10.7, make sure this is your python version you run the script in. 
### 4.1 Installing packages
From the command line:
Clone this repository to your console by running the command `git clone https://github.com/NiGitaMyrGit/vis_assignment2.git`. This will copy the repository to the location you are currently in.
Then make sure you are located in the main folder, location can be changed by using the command `cd path\to\vis_assignment2`'. From here run the command `bash setup.sh` which will install all the required packages in order to run the script.

### 4.2 Dataset
This scritp uses the ```Cifar10``` dataset which is directly loaded into the script.

### 4.3 running the scripts
In the command line make sure you are located in the main folder.
Run the command `python3 src/logireg_cifar10.py` for running the ligistic regression script and `python3 src/neural_cifar10.py`
For this asignment I have used argparse so the user can customise the output path of the classification reports with the flag -r.
Eg.
`python3 logireg_cifar10.py -r custom/path/to/report.txt` or `python3 neural_cifar10.py -r custom/path/to/report.txt`
The default path is default='out/neuralnetwork_report.txt' which means the classification
## 5. Results - discussion
The accuracy of the logistic regression is 0.31 and 0.35 for the neural network. This is not overwhelmingly good results. With longer training time and perhaps some data augmentation it might do better.

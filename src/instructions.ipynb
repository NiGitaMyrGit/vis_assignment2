    "# Assignment 2 - Classification benchmarks with Logistic Regression and Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we'll be writing scripts which classify the ```Cifar10``` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should write code which does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the Cifar10 dataset\n",
    "- Preprocess the data (e.g. greyscale, reshape)\n",
    "- Train a classifier on the data\n",
    "- Save a classification report\n",
    "\n",
    "Write two script: which does this for a **logistic regression classifier** and one which does it for a **neural network classifier**. In both cases, you should use the machine learning tools available via ```scikit-learn```.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should structure your project by having scripts saved in a folder called ```src```, and have a folder called ```out``` where you save the classification reports.\n",
    "- Consider using some of the things we've seen in class, such as virtual environments and setup scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "- To ensure that you can use ```scikit-learn``` to build simple benchmark classifiers on image classification data\n",
    "- To demonstrate that you can build reproducible pipelines for machine learning projects\n",
    "- To make sure that you can structure repos appropriately\n",
